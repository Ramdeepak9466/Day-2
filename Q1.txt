The difference between documents and window objects

Window manages browser interactions, while Document acts as an interface for content manipulation.

Document objects
- It's the HTML document that appears in the browser window and serves as an interface for interacting with the web pageâ€™s content.

Windows objects
- It's a global object in client-side JavaScript, 
  representing the browser window containing a DOM document and acting as the root of the document object model.
